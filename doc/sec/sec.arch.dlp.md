数据泄密防护(DLP)是通过一定的技术手段，防止企业的指定数据或信息资产以违反安全策略规定的形式流出企业的一种策略

数据泄漏的途径可归类为三种：在使用状态下的泄密、在存储状态下的泄密和在传输状态下的泄密。
一般企业可通过安装防火墙、杀毒软件等方法来阻挡外部的入侵，但是事实上97%的信息泄密事件源于企业内部，
所以就以上三种泄密途径分析，信息外泄的根源在于：
  1、使用泄漏；1）操作失误导致技术数据泄漏或损坏；2）通过打印、剪切、复制、粘贴、另存为、重命名等操作泄漏数据。
  2、存储泄漏：1） 数据中心、服务器、数据库的数据被随意下载、共享泄漏；2）离职人员通过U盘、CD/DVD、移动硬盘随意拷走机密资料；3）移动笔记本被盗、丢失或维修造成数据泄漏。
  3、传输泄漏：1）通过email、QQ、MSN等轻易传输机密资料；2）通过网络监听、拦截等方式篡改、伪造传输数据。

4. Symantec Data Loss Prevention
Symantec Data Loss Prevention

Symantec’s DLP solution combines user activity tracking with data risk controls. It can monitor data held on servers, desktops, mobile devices, and in cloud storage. An initial sweep on installation identifies all locations that hold sensitive data and gives you the option to remove it all to a central management server, secure data repository or secure it in place. You receive templates and workflows for compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS standards.

Key Features:

User activity tracking
Encryption protection
HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS compliant
The tool logs all access to sensitive data and tracks those accounts that have raised alerts. Sensitive documents are encrypted and can only be seen by authorized users. The tool also makes sure that discarded copies and retired documents are completely destroyed, leaving no recoverable versions in memory. All copies are tracked and kept secure even when sent out to remote locations or onto user-owned mobile devices.

The Symantec DLP contains documents with sensitive data by using encryption and it identifies the intended recipients by fingerprinting every copy. This encryption and access identification are paired with data movement and copy restrictions. This enables you to block files and data from being attached to emails or transferred over the network or the internet.

The Symantec DLP system is part of its endpoint protection system. This searches for intrusion and malicious software, which could compromise your data privacy. This system includes the monitoring of software that is not authorized by the business but is installed on the same device as sensitive data – a situation that is particularly common in the case of the use of user-owned devices for access to company data.

Pros:
Combines DLP with user activity tracking, giving it additional functionality
Automatic scanning can map out sensitive locations where data is stored
Offers pre-built temples and works flow for major compliance standards, offering good out of box functionality

Teramind DLP will help you to be compliant with GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS. The tool starts off by searching your entire system for sensitive data. The search follows typical data formats, such as Social Security or credit card numbers. It also uses OCR and natural language processing to scan all documents. It then prioritizes those that contain personally identifiable information, personal financial data, and personal health information. Scans to spot new instances of these data categories continue during the software’s service life.

Key Features:

System audit
GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS compliant
Ongoing risk assessment
The package includes templates for data security policies that will help you set your DLP strategy. This tool has two focuses: insider threats and data security. The user tracking functions cover activities on websites, applications, and on the network. It monitors emails and also includes a keystroke logger for special scrutiny.

Overall system activity is measured to establish a baseline of normal behavior. This is a typical strategy of intrusion detection systems so it will identify external as well as internal threats.

Data protection measures include clipboard monitoring and blocking. A fingerprinting system for files will enable you to trace who leaked a file.

The console for the software includes a Risk Dashboard, which centralizes notifications of all threats and vulnerabilities that require investigation.

Pros:
Great user interface, simple to navigate and learn

7. SecureTrust Data Loss Prevention
SecureTrust DLP

This is a good option if you are having difficulty working out your DLP security strategy. When you install the software, it will present you with a list of 70 policies, which you can activate. Reading through the explanations of each will probably give you some suggestions for data control that you hadn’t even thought of.

Data Loss Prevention is part of a suite of security management tools from SecureTrust. The company also produces a SIEM tool, which is a great option for detecting and blocking intruders. These two tools can work together, although SecureTrust states that the DLP utility is efficient at detecting malicious activity by itself.

The security system scans all channels of communication for privacy violations. These include file transfer applications, email, chat apps, file sharing systems, blogs, and social media. The response mechanism of the tool automatically blocks transfers midstream. It will also identify the correspondents at each end of the data transfer.

8. Check Point Data Loss Prevention Software Blade
Check Polint Data Loss Prevention Software Blade

Check Point is one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world. This company’s data loss prevention solution includes a great deal of assistance to help you get your data protection strategy in place. This is because the package includes policies, so you just have to check which of those fit with your security strategy requirements and activate them.

The remediation module of the tool takes a different approach to user activity management to that used by the other utilities in this list. Rather than alerting IT department staff of unwelcome activity and automatically shutting down the user’s account or file access, it issues a warning directly to the user.

The ethos behind this approach is to educate the user community about the rules of data access rather than trying to catch them out when they cross a line that they didn’t know about. The data usage scrutiny of the system extends to emails.

Pros:
Good for companies who want to help educate users as they attempt to access information inappropriately
Supports major compliance standards
Supports email scanning that can automatically restrict emails from being sent
Cons:
Interface be easily be cluttered with an excessive amount of events, making it hard to use at scale
Warns the user directly, which isn’t always an option sysadmins want
Would like to see better out-of-box templates and options for DLP
Policies can be difficult to customize
The Data Loss Prevention Software Blade includes reporting and auditing for HIPAA, SOX, and PCI DSS. The tool is available on a 30-day free trial.

9. Digital Guardian Endpoint DLP
Digital Guardian Endpoint DLP

The Digital Guardian Endpoint DLP starts its service life by searching through-out your system for sensitive data. The tool logs those locations and tracks all events that occur at them. It is able to communicate with the Windows, Mac OS, and Linux operating systems and its tracking capabilities extend out to cloud resources. This package focuses on endpoint security. Digital Guardian produces a companion tool that hardens networks against data loss events.

The endpoint data protection system can block activities on offline computers as well as monitoring devices over the network. It will automatically block unauthorized user actions, such as the destruction, alteration, copying, or transferring of protected data. This equally prevents both insider and outsider activities.

10. Code42
Code42

You will notice from the descriptions of the other tools here that corporate data protection strategies are implemented within the DLP tool by rule bases, called “policies.” Code42 has a different system and doesn’t use policies. Despite not operating on policies, the tool does link detected problems with remediation actions.

Code42 works on data files the way a SIEM tool behaves with log files. It monitors data files, backing them up and restoring the original version should any changes be made. It also tracks every access to those data files and blocks any copy or transfer actions.

All actions on files, including those performed by Code42 are recorded, which generates the audit trail that you need for data security standards. The tool includes an analysis utility that uses event information to present exposure of internal misdeeds or intrusion threats.

Priorities for DLP
The first and most obvious topic to deal with when trying to prevent the data your business stores is to control access to it. However, this is not your only task. In order to prove compliance with data security standards, you are going to need some evidence. So, constant transaction logging is needed, and you are going to need to store those logs for years so that they can be available for spot audits. Constant self-auditing is also necessary to ensure that security procedures are sufficiently strong.

Although failure to protect data is a setback, any leakage should not be covered up. Non-disclosure of data leakage is a big mistake. It will cause you to lose your accreditation. Data protection standards all include protocols for data loss notification and they should be followed.

Surprisingly, most organizations don’t properly track all of the locations on the system where data is stored. Staff might keep notes in documents on their desktop computers and forget to delete them; other local stores, such as contact databases can sometimes be overlooked. It is important to centralize the data storage and track access to it.

The data held by your company is a potential money earner for hackers. So, you have to properly defend your network against intrusion. However, authorized users also present a security risk. They might be tricked into passing on data to outsiders or might be motivated through resentment or greed to steal the company’s data. Preventing the copying of data onto portable devices, or printout, or sending data out through email, or a chat app is another important requirement of your DLP system.

Compliance to a data security standard is also important in order to win contracts. The public sector is very strong about protecting personal data and they ripple that priority through all of the services that they buy. So, if you don’t implement effective data loss prevention you will be locked out of the opportunity for new contracts. The need to comply with the standards of the public sector continues through the supply chain. So, even if you don’t bid for public sector contracts, your ability to do deals with businesses that do work for the public sector will be reduced.

Conclusion
Data loss events were once seen as an unfortunate risk. The IT industry and the legal systems of most advanced economies recognize that no IT system can ever be 100 percent secure. However, the requirements for companies to take all possible steps to prevent data disclosure have become far stricter in recent years.

Many businesses are unable to fully identify all of the locations of data storage and fixing that issue is the first step to a comprehensive data loss prevention strategy. Getting the right DLP tools is very important and you won’t be able to fully comply with the law or data security standards without them. Without standards accreditation, you will be barred from bidding for many contracts and without full data loss protection systems you run the risk of a disclosure event, which could lead to destructive prosecutions.

You run a great risk of your business being destroyed if you don’t have a data protection strategy. Data loss prevention software is no longer optional.

What is a data loss prevention policy?
A data loss prevention policy is a set of rules and workflows laid down by your business to define how to allow access to data and protect the information that you hold. This strategy applies to working procedures, access rights management, activity monitoring procedures, reporting requirements, and disaster recovery measures.

What is a DLP alert?
A DLP alert is a system-generated message. A DLP tool monitors activities, such as data storage access and network traffic. The software will raise an alert if an activity lies outside registered acceptable behavior. The alert does not necessarily mean that a data loss event has occurred. It could identify a potential risk or a system weakness that the actions of intruders have exposed without successfully touching the target data. An alert should instigate an investigation into the necessity of adjusting security standards or taking some other preventative measures or it could indicate a security breach in progress.
